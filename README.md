# Assignment 1 - UI Mockups

__This assignment is worth 500 points and due 11:59PM June 16th__

For this assignment, you will be creating a series of user interface mockups for a content management system web application.  These will be created with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript, with each mockup created in a separate HTML file using embedded `<style>` and `<script>` element to supply the CSS and JavaScript rules for each page.

_You may not use external JS/CSS libraries like Bootstrap for this project!_

### Requirements
You will find the Codio Project for the assignment comes pre-loaded with a mockups folder (see the Filetree to the left, or access it from the menu with `View > Filetree` 

You will need to edit these files to create your mockups, conforming to the requirements laid out in the [KSOL assignment page](https://k-state.instructure.com/courses/77041/pages/assignment-number-1-site-mockups).

You can open any file by clicking it in the filetree.  Additionally, you can preview it using Codio's [static preview tool](https://codio.com/docs/ide/features/inline-preview/) by right-clicking it, and selecting `Preview Static` in the context menu.  This preview will attach and interpret any linked JavaScript and CSS.

__Note: The static previewer will not render alert boxes triggered by JavaScript's `alert()` function__

### Turning In your Work
To turn in your work, you will need to select `Education > Mark as Complete` from the menu.  This will convert your box to a read-only status and inform the instructor it is ready to be graded.
